1041 Be Unique (20)

Being unique is so important to people on Mars that even their lottery is designed in a unique way. The rule of winning is simple: one bets on a number chosen from [1,10^4]. 
The first one who bets on a unique number wins. For example, if there are 7 people betting on { 5 31 5 88 67 88 17 }, then the second one who bets on 31 wins.

Input:
Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains a line which begins with a positive integer N (≤10^5) and then followed by N bets. The numbers are separated by a space.

Output:
For each test case, print the winning number in a line. If there is no winner, print None instead.

Sample Input 1:
7 5 31 5 88 67 88 17
Sample Output 1:
21

Sample Input 1:
5 888 666 666 888 888
