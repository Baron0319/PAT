1058 A+B in Hogwarts (20)

If you are a fan of Harry Potter, you would know the world of magic has its own currency system -- as Hagrid explained it to Harry, "Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough."
Your job is to write a program to compute A+B where A and B are given in the standard form of Galleon.Sickle.Knut (Galleon is an integer in [0,10^7], Sickle is an integer in [0, 17), and Knut is an integer in [0, 29)).

Input 
Each input file contains one test case which occupies a line with A and B in the standard form, separated by one space.

Output 
For each test case you should output the sum of A and B in one line, with the same format as the input.

Sample Input:
3.2.1 10.16.27

Sample Output:
14.1.28

    printf("%d.%d.%d\n",g,s%17,k%29);
